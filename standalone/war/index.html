<h2>1.0.0.Beta4 Release Notes</h2>

<p>
    <h3>Functional scope</h3>
    This release does cleanup the left hand side navigation, moving editor actions to
        the right hand side content panel.
    <ul>
        <li>Form databinding & validation</li>
        <li>Integration with the domain controller</li>
        <li>General UI framework (MVP)</li>
    </ul>
    Functionally this release does focus on the outermost domain management use cases,
        that act as POC for the building blocks listed above.
    <ul>
        <li>Start/Stop server instances</li>
        <li>Create server groups and server configurations</li>
        <li>Configure server groups and configurations</li>
    </ul>

        The standalone server Web UI doesn't contain any reasonable functionality at this point.
    </p>

        <p>
            The work on management use cases that relate to subsystems has not begun yet.
            There are merely two examples (Datasource and JMS) that act as a preview
            and should give you an idea where things are going.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>Browser compatibility</h3>
            This release has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
            Internet Explorer has not been verified yet, but we don't expect it to work
            properly in releases before IE8.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            Your feedback is greatly appreciated. Tell us what you think about the current
            way the content is organized within the UI. Identify the top three things that don't make sense
            to you or that you couldn't find easily in the console. Send these issues to:
